checks for customers:
  - duplicate_count(customer_id) = 0
  - row_count between 500 and 10000  # if this check fails, we need to open up a new store
  - invalid_count(customer_type) = 0:
      valid values: [new, returning]
  - schema:
      fail:
        when forbidden column present: [pii*]  # all sensitive columns start with "pii_"
  - min(count_lifetime_orders) > 0:
      name: Don't keep customers who haven't ordered in the database
      filter: first_ordered_at > '2015-01-01'::timestamp  # unless they're old customers
  - invalid_percent(customer_name) < 10 %:  # it's ok if some customers have weird names
      valid regex: ^[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+$
